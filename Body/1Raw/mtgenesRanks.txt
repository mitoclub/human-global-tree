# In this table mitochondrial genes are ranged by theirs evolutionary constraints. 
# First genes were ranged by three metrics (KnKsMouse, FunctionalIndispensabilityScore, GenomeWideHaploinsuffisencyScore) independently and then all ranks were summed and result is written in SumRanks column. 
# Genes are ranged by SumRanks in ascending order where smaller values meen more constraint genes and bigger values meen more relaxed genes.
# Metrics that were used for SumRanks calculation:
# -KnKsMouse (the less value, the more intolerant gene)
# -Functional Indispensability Score - Proteins are classified as 'indispensable' based on their impact on the network upon removal of the specific protein (the more value, the more intolerant gene). 
# -Genome-Wide Haploinsufficiency Score - Haploinsufficiency is defined as a dominant phenotype in diploid organisms that are heterozygous for a loss-of-function allele (the more value, the more intolerant gene).
